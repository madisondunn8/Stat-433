How to submit a homework assignment:

First, click on the link for the homework that I provide on the class webpage. That will lead you to a series of prompts. Click through those prompts. By clicking through, it should copy my files (i.e. “repository”) and make you a “repository” or a “repo”. It might take awhile for the files to download. While you wait, you can start the next steps.
Go to Rstudio and create a new Rstudio “project”. On the first screen that pops up, all the way at the bottom, there should be an option “Version Control”. Click on that. Then, “Git”.
Go back to your web browser. If the files from step 2 are done copying, then you should have a repo page that looks like this. On the right side of the page, click the button “Clone or download” in your repo. Copy that web address that comes up.
Back in RStudio, paste that url in “repository URL”. You can give it your own name. Then, find a folder where you want to save it on your computer. Ideally, you already have a folder for this class. Then, click “create project”.
You can then edit the files and make new files (i.e. do the “actual work”). Along the way, you can click on the cool new “github” icon at the top of RStudio. Click “commit”, select the files that you want to save, and provide a brief explaination of the changes that you made since the last time you click commit.
When you want to move all of your updates to github (i.e. online), again, click the cool new “github” icon. This time click “push branch”. You may be asked for your github user name and password.
After the push is complete, go back to your repo’s webpage and see if you can see the changes!
